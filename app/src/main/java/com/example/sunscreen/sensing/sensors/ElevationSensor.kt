    // UV exposure increases by 10-12% for every 1 km elevation gain,
    // as there is less atmosphere to absorb the UV.
    // This could be used to enhance the forecast data. Forecast data in mountainous areas is usually
    // based on a nearby town rather than on the peak of the mountain. The difference can be sunny
    // vs a blizzard, 50 degrees temperature difference, or 50 mph wind difference.
    // I generally use a mountain specific forecast before heading up (https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Maroon-Bells/forecasts/4315)
    // Could get this info from barometer, or via GPS location.
